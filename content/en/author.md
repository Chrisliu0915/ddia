**Martin Kleppmann** is a researcher in distributed systems at the University of Cambridge, UK. 
Previously he was a software engineer and entrepreneur at internet companies including LinkedIn and Rapportive, where he worked on large-scale data infrastructure.
In the process he learned a few things the hard way, and he hopes this book will save you from repeating the same mistakes.

Martin is a regular conference speaker, blogger, and open source contributor. He believes that profound technical ideas should be accessible to everyone, and that deeper understanding will help us develop better software.

**Chris Riccomini** is a software engineer, startup investor, and author with 15+ years of experience at PayPal, LinkedIn, and WePay. 
He runs Materialized View Capital, where he invests in infrastructure startups. He is also the cocreator of Apache Samza and SlateDB, 
and coauthor of The Missing README: A Guide for the New Software Engineer.
